The Authentication Header (AH) authenticates the origin of data, and guarantees the integrity of the 
information thatâ€™s being sent using IPSec. It also provides anti-reply security.

AH ensures that there is no retransmission of data from an unauthorized source, and protects against 
data tampering. ESP provides with content protection and ensures that there is integrity and 
confidentiality for the message. ESP can operate in two modes, transport mode and tunnel mode.

Integrity means that computer system assets can be modified only by authorized parities. 
Confidentiality means that the assets can only be accessed by authorized parties. 
Availability refers to the accessibility of the resource to the authorized parties. 
Authenticity means that the asset is not unethically changed.
