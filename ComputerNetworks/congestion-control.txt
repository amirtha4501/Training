Two broad categories of congestion control are Open-loop and Closed-loop.

Open loop congestion control techniques are used to prevent congestion before it even happens by 
enforcing certain policies. Retransmission policy, window policy and acknowledgement policy are 
some policies that might be enforced.

Closed loop congestion control techniques are used to treat congestion after it has happened.
Some of the methods used are backpressure and choke packet.

The technique in which a congested node stops receiving data from the immediate upstream node or nodes 
is called as Backpressure, where (the congested node propagates in the opposite direction of the data flow 
to inform the predecessor node to reduce the flow of packets).

Backpressure technique can be applied only to Virtual circuit networks.

The packet sent by a node to the source to inform it of congestion is called Choke.

In Selective Repeat, the sender side uses a searching algorithm to find the packets which need 
to be retransmitted based on the negative acknowledgements received and then resends only those 
packets thus saving bandwidth.

In Go-Back-N window, when the timer of the packet times out, several packets have to be resent even 
some may have arrived safe. 

In slow-start algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases exponentially until it reaches a 
threshold. When it reaches the threshold, it stops increasing and continues sending packets through 
the threshold window thus preventing congestion.

In the congestion avoidance algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases additively until 
congestion is detected. Once congestion is detected, the size of congestion window is decreased once 
and then the packets are transmitted to achieve congestion avoidance.
