Queuing delay:
    When there are multiple packets which are to be sent, the packets have to wait in the queue that time
    is called queuing delay.

Transmission delay:
    There will be a delay to convert the packet into bits to be transmitted.

Propagation delay:
    There will be delay to propagate the bits through the physical medium.

Processing delay:
    The time required to examine the packetâ€™s header and determine where to direct the packet.

Transmission delay = L/R (length / transmission rate)
    For a 10Mbps Ethernet link, if the length of the packet is 32bits, the transmission delay is
        = 32/10 
        = 3.2 microseconds.

Transmission delay does not depend on Distance between the routers
    Transmission delay = packet length / transmission rate. 
    The transmission rate depends upon the bandwidth of the medium.

Traffic Intensity = (Number of bits in packet * Average Transmission rate) / Current Transmission rate
                  = La/R 

N = number of routers + final node

The total nodal delay is given by 
    dnodal = dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop

Propagation delay is caused when the packet is in its electric signal form and is travelling through a 
medium (a wire or a electromagnetic wave). Propagation delay is the time it takes a bit to propagate from 
one router to the next. If the distance between the routers is increased, it will take longer time to 
propagate, that is, there would be more propagation delay.
