DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol) provides IP address to the client.
DHCP is used for both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.

Whenever a DHCP server gets a request from a client it responds with a DHCP offer containing IP address 
being offered, network mask offered, the amount of time that the client can use and keep it, the ip address 
of the DHCP server making this offer.

DHCP uses UDP port 67 for sending data to the server.
67 is the UDP port number that is used as the destination port of a server. 
Whereas UDP port number 68 is used by the client.

DHCP client and servers on the same subnet communicate via UDP broadcast

ARP - address resolution protocol 
    It is used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses that are present in the local network.

DHCP snooping is a security feature that is used in OS of a network in the layer 2. This technology 
prevents unauthorized DHCP servers offering IP addresses to DHCP clients.
