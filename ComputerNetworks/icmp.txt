Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) has been designed to compensate 
    Error-reporting
    Error-correction
    Host and management queries

An ICMP message has an 8-byte header and a variable size data section.

ICMP error message will not be generated for a datagram having a special address such as 127.0.0.0(spl address/ loopback address)

The source-quench message in ICMP was designed to add a kind of flow control to the IP.

In case of time exceeded error, when the datagram visits a router, the value of time to live field is Decremented by 1

The round-trip time refers to the total time taken combining the time taken for a packet sent from 
a source to reach a destination and the time taken the acknowledgement sent by the destination to reach 
the source. The Router sends destination unreachable message if the destination is not found.

Ping program is used to find if a host is alive and responding.
Traceroute(unix) / Tracert(windows) is a program used to find the shortest route to the destination IP.
