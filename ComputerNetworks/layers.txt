The data from application layer is sent to transport layer and is converted to segments. 
These segments are then transferred to the network layer and these are called packets. These packets 
are then sent to data link layer where they are encapsulated into frames. These frames are then transferred 
to physical layer where the frames are converted to bits. Error control and flow control data is inserted 
in the frames at the data link layer.

Error control is a function of the data link layer and the transport layer.

Physical layer 
    - It is responsible for the movements of individual bits from one hop(node) to the next.
    - To transmit over a medium, to provide mechanical and electrical specifications.

Data link layer(node to node)
    - It is responsible for the movements of frames from one hop(node) to the next.
    - To organize bits into frames and to provide hop-to-hop delivery

Network layer 
    - It is responsible for the movements of individual packets from the source host to the destination host.
    - To provide internetworking.

Transport layer(process to process)
    - It is responsible for the delivery of the message from one process to another and responsible for 
    segmentation of the data.
    - To provide reliable process-to-process message delivery using ports and error recovery.

Session layer 
    - It is responsible for dialog control and synchronization.
    - To establish, manage and terminate sessions.

Presentation layer 
    - It is responsible for translation, compression and encryption.

Application layer(end to end service)
    - It is responsible for providing services to the user.
    - To allow access to the Network resources.
