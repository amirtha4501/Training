There are five layers in the Internet Protocol stack. 
The five layers in Internet Protocol stack is 
        Application, 
        Transport, 
        Network, 
        Data link and 
        Physical layer. 
The internet protocol stack model is also called the TCP/IP model and itâ€™s used in modern Internet Communication.

The seven layers in ISO OSI reference model is 
        Application, 
        Presentation, 
        Session, 
        Transport, 
        Network, 
        Data link and 
        Physical layer. 
OSI stands for Open System Interconnect and it is a generalized model.

Application layer, presentation layer, session layer and transport layer are implemented in the end system. 

Physical, data link and network layers are network support layers.
Session, presentation and application layers are user support layers. 
The transport layer links these layers by segmenting and rearranging the data. It uses protocols like TCP and UDP.
