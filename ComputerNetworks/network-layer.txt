The network layer is concerned with packets of data.

It provides data routing paths for network communications.

A 4 byte IP address consists of network address and host address.
The size of the host address and network address depends upon the class of 
the address in classful IP addressing.

In virtual circuit network each packet contains a short VC number.
    A short VC number also called as VCID (virtual circuit identifier) is a type of identifier 
    which is used to distinguish between several virtual circuits in a connection oriented circuit 
    switched network. 
    Each virtual circuit is used to transfer data over a larger packet switched network.

The routing algorithm is what decides where a packet should go next.
    There are several routing techniques like
        - shortest path algorithm, 
        - static and dynamic routing, 
        - decentralized routing, 
        - distance vector routing, 
        - link state routing, 
        - Hierarchical routing etc.

In multi-destination routing, there is more than one receiver and the route for each destination 
which is contained in a list of destinations is to be found by the routing algorithm. 
Multi-destination routing is also used in broadcasting.

The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is used by the network layer for the function of dynamic routing.

Congestion control focuses on the flow of the traffic in the network and uses algorithms like traffic 
aware routing, admission control and load shedding to deal with congestion.

There are several protocols used in Network layer. Some of them are IP, ICMP, CLNP, ARP, IPX, HRSP etc.

ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol 
    It is used by networking devices to send error messages and operational information indicating a host 
    or router cannot be reached. 
    ICMP operates over the IP packet to provide error reporting functionality as IP by itself cannot
    report errors.
