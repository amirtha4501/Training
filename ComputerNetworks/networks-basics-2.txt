Packet switching and Circuit switching are two different types of switching methods used to connect the 
multiple communicating devices with one another. Packet switching is used in conventional LAN systems 
and circuit switching is used in telephonic systems.

Global address is a network address that is unique internationally and is used as a common address 
by all the users of the network. It is used to create a virtual circuit identifier.

The Identifier that is used for data transfer in virtual circuit network is called Virtual circuit identifier.

A virtual circuit identifier is a type of numeric identifying address that is used to distinguish 
between different virtual circuits in a circuit-switched network. It is used for data transfer 
and has a switch scope.

The protocol field enables the demultiplexing feature so that the IP protocol can be used to carry payloads 
of more than one protocol type. Its most used values are 17 and 6 for UDP and TCP respectively.

IP does not provide reliable delivery service for the data. Itâ€™s dependent upon the transport layer 
protocols like TCP to offer reliability.

Offset field helps to check rearrangement of the fragments. 
The offset of the first fragment will always be 0.

In classless addressing, there are no classes but addresses are still granted in blocks.

There are only five classes of IP addresses: 
    Class A (0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255), 
    Class B (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255), 
    Class C (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255), 
    Class D (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255), and 
    Class E (240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255).
