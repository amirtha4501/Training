An IPv6 address is 128 bits long. 
Therefore, 2128 i.e. 340 undecillion addresses are possible in IPv6. 

IPv4(32-bits) has only 4 billion possible addresses.

IPv6 datagram has fixed header length of 40bytes.

In the IPv6 header, the traffic class field is similar to Type of Service(ToS) field in the IPv4 header.

There is no concept of broadcast address in IPv6. Instead, there is an anycast address in IPv6 which 
allows sending messages to a group of devices but not all devices in a network. 
Anycast address is not standardized in IPv4.

The Hop limit field determines the lifetime of IPv6 datagram.

Suppose two IPv6 nodes want to interoperate using IPv6 datagrams, but they are connected to each other 
by intervening IPv4 routers. The best solution here is Tunneling.

Dual-stack approach refers to node has both IPv4 and IPv6 support.

A link local address of local addresses is used in an Isolated subnet.

In subcategories of reserved address in IPv6, address that is used by a host to test itself without 
going into network is called loop back address. 
IPv6 loopback address is 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001. 
IPv4 loopback address is 127.0.0.1. Itâ€™s a reserved address.

Prefix is the bits in the IPv6 address which are placed in leftmost position.

In IPv6 address format, the starting bits are specified with eight 0s to represent reserved addresses. 
These reserved addresses have a certain function pre-defined like the loop-back address is used to test 
a network card. Reserved addresses cannot be allotted to a machine.

Range of port numbers in Internet model is 0 and 65,535(16-bit).
    - Well-known port numbers range from 0 to 1023
    - registered port numbers are from 1024 to 49151
    - dynamic port numbers are from 49152 to 65535
