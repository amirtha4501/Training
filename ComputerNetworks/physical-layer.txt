Physical layer deals with bit to bit delivery in networking. 

The data unit in the physical layer is bits.

Fiber optics is considered to have the highest transmission speed mostly. The fiber optics transmission
runs at 1000Mb/s. It is called as 1000Base-Lx whereas IEEE standard = 802.3z. 
It is used for modern network connections due to its high transmission rate.

The portion of physical layer that interfaces with the medium access control sublayer 
is Physical Signalling Sublayer. 
The main function of this layer is 
    character encoding, 
    reception, 
    decoding and 
    performs optional isolation functions. 
It handles which media connection the signal should be forwarded to physically.

Anything dealing with a network cable or the standards in use â€“ including pins, 
connectors and the electric current used is dealt in the physical layer.
