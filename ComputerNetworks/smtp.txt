Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) - client-server architecture

When the mail server sends mail to other mail servers it becomes SMTP client

Since only 7-bit ASCII codes are transmitted through SMTP, it is mandatory to convert binary multimedia
data to 7-bit ASCII before it is sent using SMTP.

In SMTP, the command to write receiver’s mail address is written with the command RCPT TO

In SMTP, the sending mail server pushes the mail to receiving mail server hence it is push protocol. 
In a pull protocol such as HTTP, the receiver pulls the resource from the sending server.

The ports 15, 35 and 50 are all UDP ports.
SMTP only uses TCP port 25 for reliability.

When the sender and the receiver of an email are on different systems, we need only Two UAs and two MTAs.
The sender’s User Agent (UA) submits the message to a Message Transfer Agent (MTA). Then the MTA sends 
the message to another MTA i.e. a mail relay. Then the receiver receives the message from the mail relay 
whenever it is available.

The user agent is basically a software program that allows the user to send, and receive e-mail messages. 
Routing of the message is done by the Message Transfer Agent.

SMTP connections secured by SSL are known as SMTPS.

ODMR is an extension to SMTP, in which mails are relayed to the receivers after they are authenticated. 
It allows only the authorized receivers to receive the mail.
