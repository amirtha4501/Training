The combination of Subnet number and host number is often termed the local address of the local portion 
of the IP address.

Static subnetting implies that all subnets obtained from the same subnet mask.

We've an IP address of 172.16.13.5 with a 255.255.255.128 subnet mask. What is the class of address, 
subnet address, and broadcast address?
    // Class A, Subnet 172.16.13.0, Broadcast address 172.16.13.127
       Class B, Subnet 172.16.13.0, Broadcast address 172.16.13.127
    // Class B, Subnet 172.16.13.0, Broadcast address 172.16.13.255
    // Class B, Subnet 172.16.0.0, Broadcast address 172.16.255.255
The prefix 172 lies in class B (128 to 191) of IPv4 addresses. 
From the subnet mask, the class is divided into 2 subnets: 172.16.13.0 to 172.16.13.127 
                                                           172.16.13.128 to 172.16.13.255. 
The IP 172.16.13.5 lies in the first subnet. So the starting address 172.16.13.0 is the subnet address 
and last address 172.16.13.127 is the broadcast address.
