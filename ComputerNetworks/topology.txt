Topology in networks is the structure or pattern in which each and every node in the network is connected.

Topology types:
    mesh
    star
    bus
    ring
    hybrid

In star topology, no computer is connected to another computer directly but all the computers are connected 
to a central hub. Every message sent from a source computer goes through the hub and the hub then forwards 
the message only to the intended destination computer.

In bus topology, there is a single cable to which all the network nodes are connected. 
So whenever a node tries to send a message or data to other nodes, this data passes through all 
other nodes in the network through the cable. It is really simple to install but itâ€™s not secure enough 
to be used in most of the computer network applications.

WAN - Wide Area Network. 
    This network extends over a large geographical area such as to connect cities, states or even countries. 
    A wireless connection is required to build a WAN. The best example of WAN is the Internet.
    They can be connected through leased lines or satellites.

LAN - Local Area Network. 
    This network interconnects computers in a small area such as schools, offices, residence etc. 
    It is the most versatile kind of data communication system where most of the computer network concepts 
    can be visibly used.
