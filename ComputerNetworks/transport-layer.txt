TCP provides reliable and ordered delivery of a stream of bytes between hosts communicating via an IP network. 
Major internet applications like www, email, file transfer etc rely on TCP. 
TCP is connection oriented and it is optimized for accurate delivery rather than timely delivery.

Socket is one end point in a two way communication link in the network. TCP layer can identify the 
application that data is destined to be sent by using the port number that is bound to socket.

Winsock is a programming interface which deals with input output requests for internet applications in 
windows OS. It defines how windows network software should access network services.

The datagram congestion control is a transport layer protocol which deals with reliable connection setup, 
teardown, congestion control, explicit congestion notification, and feature negotiation.

A port is a TCP name for a transport service access point.
The network port identifies the application or service running on the computer. 
A port number is 16 bits. 
The combination of IP address preceded with the port number is called the socket address.

The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol used in networking 
system where streams of data are to be continuously transmitted between two connected network nodes. 
Some of the other transport layer protocols are RDP, RUDP, TCP, DCCP, UDP etc.
