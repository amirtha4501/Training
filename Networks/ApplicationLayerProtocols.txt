Application Layer Protocols:
    This layer describes the protocols that software applications
    interact with most often.

    The specification includes descriptions of the remote login protocol
    Telnet, the FTP and the SMTP.

    Also HTTP, and HTTPS

    HTTPS is secured by Transport Layer Security(TLS)

    TLS can be said to be the top-most layer of the networking model
    described by the Internet protocol suite.
