IPv4 and IPv6
    The both versions describe how devices on the Internet are
    assigned IP addresses.

IPv4:
    It has only 32 bits for addressing, allowing for about 4.3 billion
    possible address.

    IPv4 will eventually suffer from address exhaustion as more and more
    people use more devices on the Internet.

IPv6:
    It aims tp solve address exhaustion by using 128 bits for addresses.
