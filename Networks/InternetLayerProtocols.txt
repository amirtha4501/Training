Internet layer protocols

    Protocols in this layer describe how data is sent and received
    over the Internet.

    The process involves packaging data into packets, addressing and
    transmitting packets, and receiving incoming packets of data.

    IP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that it provides no guarantee
    that packets are sent or received in the right order, along the same
    path, or even in their entirety.

    Reliability is handled by other protocols in the suite, such as in 
    the transport layer.
