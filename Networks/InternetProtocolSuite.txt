Internet Protocol Suite:

    Since the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol
    and the Internet Protocol, the Internet Protocol Suite is also known as TCP/IP.

    IP suite is the conceptual model and set of communication protocols used in the 
    internet and similar computer networks.

    These protocols describe how data on the Internet is packaged, 
    addressed, sent, and received.

    The  layers in the context of computer networking are mostly composed of protocols, 
    algorithms, and configurations, with some data sprinkled in.
