Link layer protocols
   
    It is the most basic, or lowest-level, classification of communication protocol. 
   
    It deals with sending information between hosts on the same local network, 
    and translating data from the higher layers to the physical layer.

    Protocols in the link layer describe how data interacts with the transmission 
    medium, such as electronic signals sent over specific hardware. 
    
    Unlike other layers, link layer protocols are dependent on the 
    hardware being used.
