    Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy 
and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of TLS is encrypting the 
communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can 
also be used to encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). In this 
article we will focus on the role of TLS in web application security.

    TLS evolved from a previous encryption protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

    HTTPS is an implementation of TLS encryption on top of the HTTP protocol, which is used by all websites 
as well as some other web services. Any website that uses HTTPS is therefore employing TLS encryption.

    There are three main components to what the TLS protocol accomplishes: Encryption, Authentication, and 
Integrity.
    Encryption: hides the data being transferred from third parties.
    Authentication: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be.
    Integrity: verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with

    SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet 
connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing 
criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details.
