Transport Layer Protocols:
    It presently encapsulates TCP and UDP.

    Like IP, User Datagram Protocol is connectionless
    and it can be used to prioritize time over reliability.

    TCP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that
    prioritizes reliability over latency.

    TCP describes transferring data in the same order as it was sent, 
    retransmitting lost packets, and controls affecting the rate
    of data transmission.
