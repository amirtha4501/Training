SELF JOIN:  A join in which a table is joined with itself.

example:

SELECT e1.emp_id, e1.first_name emp_name, e2.first_name lead_name
  FROM exercise2.employee e1, exercise2.employee e2 
 WHERE e1.lead_id = e2.emp_id; 

SELECT e1.emp_id, e1.first_name, e2.first_name lead_name
  FROM exercise2.employee e1
  LEFT JOIN exercise2.employee e2 
  ON e1.lead_id = e2.emp_id; 

Here, the LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the employee e1 i.e. left table, and the records in the 
employee e2 is returned only if the condition e1.lead_id = e2.emp_id is satisfied.

The both queries are nearly same in case of performance, but the second is the recommended one.
