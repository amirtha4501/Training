git add
--------
    - It adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
    - It doesn't affect the repository in any significant way i.e. the
    changes are not recorded until we run git commit.

Command: git add index.html // to add the specified file
         git add . // to add all files in the current directory
        

git commit
---------- 
    - It commit the changes to the repository.
    - The commit command does not save changes in remote servers, 
    only in the local repository of Git.
    - Commits are meant to be small and atomic which helps to undo
    unnecessary changes more easily and keeping a more accurate track
    of the changes in the project.
    - The --author is to change the author of the commit(s) and 
    the --date is to set the date.

Command: git commit -message "Added index.html file"
         git commit -m "Added header tag" // short form of the previous command
         git commit --author "Ammu" --date --m "Provided footer tag"

Output:
    // if it is a first commit
    [master (root-commit) 69c7fc4] Added index.html file
    1 files changed, 13 insertions (+), 0 deletion (-)
    create mode 100644 index.html

    // if not a first commit
    [master 4b93e29] Added header tag
    1 file changed, 1 insertions(+)

Analysis:
    - The first line refers to the branch in which the changes were
    committed, master branch, together with a shortened SHA-1 hash
    to uniquely identify the change and also the message with which
    we described the change.
    - The (root-commit) indicates that this change is the first one.
    and first commit doesn't have a parent.
    - The second line shows the number of files changed, and gives
    the number of insertions, deletions or modifications.
    - The last line shows the filename with the UNIX file permissions.


changes status, log
--------------------
    - Git status gives the current status of the file system.
    - Enables to have a look at the various changes that have been made
    to the current repository by using the git log command.

Commands:
    git status
    git log
    git log --oneline

Output:
status output:
    On branch master
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

    Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   src/repository/category.repository.ts        
            modified:   src/service/categories.service.ts

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

log output:

    and the commit message.
