To initialize git repository:
    - Inside a project directory
        git init
    - With explicitly specified directory
        git init in/test/project

In git terminology:
    index - It is just a preparation area for our next commit action.
            It's not aware of any files we add to the project directory unless
            we inform it.
    commit - It refers to instructing the system that some changes have been
             made to the project.
