Why we can't create object for abstract class

An abstract class may or may not have implementations for one or more methods. 
If there is a possibility to create an object for abstract class, 
and if we call any abstract methods in it, then JVM will not be able to decide what to do and how to allocate class memory.
So that it is not possible to create an object for abstract class. 
However, we can instantiate an abstract class if and only if it doesn't have any abstract methods in it.

Why we can't create object for interface

Similarly in interface, there is no implementation of methods and hence the JVM will also get strucked to allocate the memory for those.
Hence, we can't instantiate an object for it.
