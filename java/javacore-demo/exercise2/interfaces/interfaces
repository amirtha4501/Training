/*
    REQUIREMENTS:
        - To find the methods that a class which implements the java.lang.CharSequence interface have to implement
        - To find whether the interface, public interface Marker {} is valid or not
*/

The methods such as length, toString, charAt and subSequence shoud be 
implemented by a class, if it implements the java.lang.CharSequence interface.

It is possible to have an empty interface i.e. interface without any methods.
They are called Marker interfaces or tagging interfaces. It is to inform java compiler that the classes implementing
such interface can add special behavior.
