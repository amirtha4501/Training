Serialization
    - It is the process of converting an object into byte streams

Serialization Purpose
    - The sequence of bytes includes object's data, object type and type of data stored in an object
    - It is used to save object's state to recreate the object when needed.

If one of the members in a class does not implement Serializable interface
    - It will throw NotSerializableException, if the object includes a reference of an non serializable object
