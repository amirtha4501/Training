Loading is the process of finding the binary representation of a class or interface type 
with a particular name and creating a class or interface from that binary representation

STATIC CLASS LOADING
Creating objects and instance using new keyword. 
The retrieval of class definition and instantiation of the object is done at compile time.

DYNAMIC CLASS LOADING
It is achieved through Run time type identification,also called as reflection.

Reloading the class is not possible using java's builtin class loaders.
In order to reload the class, the ClassLoader subclass should be implemented.

CONSTRUCTOR TYPES
Default
No-arg
Parameterized

The constructor is to initialize the current state of the object by setting the initial values.
It's not called directly by your code, it's called by the memory allocation 
and object initialization code in the runtime. Hence

METHOD:
    - Return values
    - To exhibit the functionality of the object
    - Invoked explicitly
    - Class name and method need not to be same
CONSTRUCTOR:
    - Does not return any values
    - To initialize an object
    - Invoked implicitly
    - Class name and method need to be same
