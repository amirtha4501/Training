PSEUDOCODE:

    class AddressService {
        public List<Address> readAll() throws AppException {

            List<Address> addresses = new ArrayList<>();
            Address address = new Address();

            try {
                Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(AppConfig.dbString, AppConfig.dbUsername,
                        AppConfig.dbPassword);
                PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(Query.selectAllAddressQuery);

                ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();

                while (rs.next()) {

                    String street = rs.getString("street");
                    String city = rs.getString("city");
                    long postalCode = rs.getLong("postal_code");

                    address.setStreet(street);
                    address.setCity(city);
                    address.setPostalCode(postalCode);

                    addresses.add(address);
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("error: " + e);
            }
            return addresses;
